D3 + Python
===================

This is a fork of the original project below.

I wanted to learn a bit more about d3js and using it to render visual maps.  This seemed like the best place to start, so thankyou for letting me stand on the shoulders of giants @SJWhitworth!

Please check out his original repo below for the original project.



A simple visualisation of London's housing market data, viewable at http://www.sjwhitworth.com/files/d3/londonhousingdata.html<br>
To run locally, run londonhousing.py to generate the JSON needed for D3 to do it's thing.<br>
Then, run a HTTP server locally via Python - <b>sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000 &</b> - and browse to londonhousingdata.html on your filesystem.<br>
You must have topojson installed for the conversion to work - see here for how to install. http://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/
